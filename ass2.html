        <p>This article is about the asthra in Hinduism. For the Astras of Arjuna, see Arjuna. For other Astra weapons, see astra (disambiguation).Ashvatthama uses Narayanastra
           In Hinduism, an astra <mark>(Sanskrit: अस्त्र; also romanised as asthra)</mark>is a supernatural weapon invoked by mantras to summon the energy of a specific deity.
           This energy can be channeled into any object, which can then be used as a weapon. These weapons are imbued with spiritual and occult powers.
           The word astra later became used to describe any ranged weapon that is handheld, such as a bow and arrow.</p>

         <p>Sanatan Shastra Vidya refers to an ancient science that describes the usage and workings of different weapons. 
            Hindu mythology is host to an arsenal of divine weapons or divyastras. Each of these astras has a specific power,while some rained down arrows, some could cause winds and floods,
            while some others could even control the minds of the enemy.
             Let’s look at some of the most unique weapons found in the Puranas</p>

                <summary>Other Astras</summary>
                <h4>Vasishtha’s Brahmadanda</h4>
                <p>Brahmadanda is a weapon of self-defence, created by Brahma. It is only to be possessed by Brahmanas and its powers are dependent on its owner. The weapon is a rod capable of absorbing any incoming attack towards its owner. 
                    When Vishwamitra, in a fit of anger, unleashed the Brahmastra onto Vasishtha, it was his Brahmadanda that protected him from the lethal weapon.</p><br>

                    <h4>Ravana’s Chandrahasa</h4>
                    <p>Chandrahasa is a sword with a curved blade, representing the shape of a crescent moon. The name can be literally translated to mean ‘the laughter of the moon’. The sword was gifted to Ravana by Shiva, after Ravana sang praises of the god in repentance for his prideful act of lifting the mountain on which Shiva and Parvati were seated. The sword, however, came with a prophecy. 
                        If Ravana were to use it for any wrongful acts, the sword would return to Shiva, eventually leading to Ravana’s imminent death.</p><br>

                    <h4>Parashurama’s Vidyudabhi</h4>
                    <p>Parashurama’s axe, Vidyudabhi, was a gift from Shiva. Shiva was also the one who taught Parashurama to wield the famed battle-axe, among other martial arts. It is believed that the warrior sage threw his axe towards the sea, which caused the sea to retreat in fear.
                         The land that was given up by the sea now forms the western coast of India.</p><br>
